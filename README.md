## Overview

This one kind of stressed me out because I thought I was comfortable enough with grids, but in the end I had to resort to flex. I'll mark this as an incomplete solution and improve it in the future. Any feedback on how to improve this will be great!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
